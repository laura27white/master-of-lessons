# Master of Lessons - Judges Documentation

**Hackathon Submission: MOD Gateway Review Lessons Learned Platform**

---

## Executive Summary

**Master of Lessons** is a comprehensive platform that transforms MOD Gateway Review documents into an intelligent, searchable lessons learned library with automated recommendations. This tool addresses the critical challenge of project teams repeating past mistakes by making historical lessons accessible, categorized, and actionable.

**Key Achievement**: We've created both a structured Core Lessons Library (Branch 1) and an intelligent SME Agent system (Branch 2) that pre-populates lessons, categorizes them automatically, and provides tailored recommendations for project delivery.

### 2. Categorisation ✅
**Requirement**: Organise pre-populated lessons under meaningful themes such as procurement, governance, resourcing, risk, and delivery.

**Our Solution**:
- **Automated keyword-based categorization** using NLP-style pattern matching
- **7 Core Categories**:
  - Resource Management (staffing, SQEP, team capacity)
  - Governance (decision-making, board engagement, leadership)
  - Commercial Strategy (contracts, suppliers, procurement)
  - Stakeholder Relations (partner relationships, engagement)
  - Risk Management (mitigation, threat identification)
  - Schedule Risk (delays, timelines, deadlines)
  - Technical Delivery (capability, technical aspects)
  - General (catch-all for uncategorized)
- **Visual distribution**: Charts showing category breakdown
- **Filterable**: Users can filter lessons by category

**Evidence**:

1. System analyzes lesson content for negative indicators (e.g., "problem", "issue", "lack", "delay")
2. Scores each dimension based on frequency and severity
3. Presents visual radar showing which areas need improvement
4. Lessons filtered by category provide specific historical context
